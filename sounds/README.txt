Sound files for the Hindi Letter Learning Game

This directory should contain the following audio files:

1. correct.mp3 - Sound played when the correct letter is collected
2. wrong.mp3 - Sound played when the wrong letter is collected
3. Individual letter sounds (e.g., a.mp3, ka.mp3, etc.) - Sounds for each Hindi letter

For a complete implementation, you would need to add actual audio files for each Hindi letter sound.
These audio files should be recorded by a native Hindi speaker pronouncing each letter clearly.
